This is an IOI-like open competition for students at schools
for secondary education.
The main purpose of this contest is to give an opportunity to
Japanese delegations and candidates of delegations for training
and practice. But the contest itself is open to everybody.
Everybody is welcome to attend JOI Open Contest 2015!

The duration of the contest is 5 hours.
The same contests are held twice (Round 1 and Round 2).
Contestants can participate in one of Round 1 or Round 2 according to their
time zone. After Round 2 finishes, we will open the judging server
for one day. Interested contestants can improve and resubmit
their solutions by themselves.

Registration will be open before each contest.
A link to the registration page will appear on this page
about 30 minutes before the beginning of each contest.
Contestants can register on the contest site by themselves from
the right before the beginning of each contest until the end of it.


No prizes will be given to the contestants.
